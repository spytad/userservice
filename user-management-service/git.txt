Remember, any modifications you make in the lab environment won't be saved. If you plan to step away, use the following steps to ensure your changes push to GitHub:

Ensure that you are currently inside the Project directory.

Navigate to the project directory by using: cd <project dir>.

Set up your Git configuration:

Run: git config --global user.email "xxxd@gmail.com"
Run: git config --global user.name "xxx"
Add your changes to the staging area:

Run: git add .
Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

Run: git commit -m "Adding temporary changes to Github"
The first step is to generate an access token from GitHub.com. Follow directions from the lab Generate GitHub personal access token and copy the access token as a password in the upcoming exercises.

Push your changes to the Git repository:

Run: git push
git push --set-upstream origin master
A prompt in the terminal will prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password (your previously created Personal Access Token from Step 5).

These steps ensure your work is safely stored in GitHub, allowing you to continue when you return to the lab environment.
