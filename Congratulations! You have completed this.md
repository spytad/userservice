Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:

Generative AI has immense potential in software development, but it also brings ethical considerations that must not be overlooked. Address bias, intellectual property rights, privacy, misinformation, and accountability issues. 

DevOps prompts are used to develop containerization strategies, evaluate the CI/CD pipeline, propose scaling strategies, and develop tools for automation.

To eliminate risks, AI offers code reviews, vulnerability testing, threat detection, modeling, and automated patch management.

AI helps to automate threat detection, understand user behavior, and detect anomalies in software systems.

Variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and transformers are types of gen AI models.

Sophos Intercept X, Symantec Endpoint Security, Splunk User Behavior Analytics, Vectra Threat Detection and Response tool, and IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson are a few platforms to detect threats.

Qwiet AI Pre-Zero, Snyk Code, GitHub Advanced Security, Veracode Fix, Endor Labs, Microsoft Security Copilot, BurpGPT, and EscalateGPT are a few secure coding platforms.

AI enhances code review by automating tasks and improving analysis accuracy. Some of the tools include DeepCode, CodeScene, GitHub Co-pilot CodeClimate, PullRequest, and Snyk.

AI software debugging tools to help identify the bugs and also help with suggestions for efficient resolutions. Some of the tools include DeepCode, Sentry, DeepScan, Testim, Mabl, Codacy, and XRebel

AI ensures clear comprehension and efficient usage of software systems that simplify documentation processes while elevating quality. Some of the tools include Doxygen, NaturalDocs, Mintlify, and DocuWriter.ai

AI significantly influences software training and education through personalized learning experiences and adaptive methodologies. Some of the tools include 7Taps, Quizgecko, Kajabi, and Teachable.
